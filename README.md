# Hellerstein_Pain
This repository is related with neural pain signature matching with resting-state fMRI MVPA analysis results. 

(1) Neurosynth contains code and map from meta-analysis related with pain 

(2) Othernetworks contains resting-state networks from Smith; 

(3) PainNet_Tor_Wager contains NPS signature maps and code to caculate cosine similarity between NPS and other brain images; 

(4) Pain_16_nodes contains the defined 5mm spheres from pain signature of Tor paper.
