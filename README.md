# Hellerstein_Pain
This repository is related with neural pain signature matching with resting-state fMRI MVPA analysis results. 


. MVPA contains code to run MVPA analysis; 

. Network_density contains matlab code to caculate network density; 

. Neurosynth contains code and map from meta-analysis related with pain 
              http://neurosynth.org/


. Othernetworks contains resting-state networks from Smith; 

. PainNet_Tor_Wager contains NPS signature maps and code2 to calculate cosine similarity between NPS and other brain images; Also you can refer to Torâ€™s github for more details.
